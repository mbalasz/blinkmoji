# Blinkmoji

Interact with each other through emojis displayed on the blinkenlight.

It's an emoji "chat" web app where you can send any emoji to whoever is in the chat room (currently only one chat room per local network supported) - it'll display that emoji on their blinkenlight device.

**What is Blinkenlight?**

Check out fheinz@'s https://github.com/fheinz/Blinkenlights project. Blinkenlight is a LED display for pixel art animations.

This repo forks that project (specifically the `blinken.js` file).

## Requirements

The machine on which the web server is running has two main requirements to work properly:

### ImageMagick

Make sure you install (https://imagemagick.org/index.php) on the host machine.
`server.js` relies on the `convert` tool to convert the given emoji to a 16x16 gif.

### Emoji font

Your host machine needs to have the `Noto Color Emoji` emoji fonts installed.
On Arch Linux (it works for me) I used:

```
sudo pacman -S noto-fonts-emoji
```

On ubuntu this should work:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji
```

## Usage

### Localhost

Assuming you followed the steps from the `Requirements` section above, run: `node server.js` and go to `localhost:3000` on `Chrome` (Firefox doesn't support Web Serial API).

### Multiple devices in a local network

This is slightly more tricky, because Web Serial API requires the connection to be secure.

After you follow the guide below you should be able to access the `https://blinkmoji.com` website from your local network and connect multiple blinkenlights devices to send messages to each other.

#### Nginx

For this setup you need to host the Blinkmoji web app on Nginx. Make sure it's installed on your host machine.

Create a self-signed key and certificate pair with OpenSSL in a single command

```
$ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
```

Copy the repo file from `nginx/sites-available` to your nginx configuration `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`.

Enable the setup via a symbolic lin

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/blinkmoji.com blinkmoji.com
```

Cope the repo file from `nginx/snippets/self-signed.conf` to your nginx configuration `/etc/nginx/snippets/`.

Test your nginx configuration with `sudo nginx -t`.
Restart nginx with `sudo systemctl restart nginx.service`.

#### Trust your self-signed certificate from all computers that you want to connect from.

Every computer that wants to open blinkmoji.com needs to trust the certificate you generated from the previous step.

On mac, run `sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain" <path-to-nginx-selfsigned.cer>`

#### blinkmoji.com

To access Blinkmoji via `https://blinkmoji.com` add the ip of your device that hosts the web app to `/etc/hosts`:

```
# /etc/hosts
...
<blinkmoji-host-ip> blinkmoji.com
```
